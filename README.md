##This is the readme as to how the code functions.
##The dataset is first imported from the link and read into r, and for each of the categories(subject,activity,features) the rows of the ##  test and the train version of those categories are binded using the rbind command
##The subject and activity datasets are merged by the columns, and the data is subsetted by the features. 
##The names are then made understandable.
